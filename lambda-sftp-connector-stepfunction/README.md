# SFTP Server to Amazon S3

This pattern shows how to use AWS Transfer Family SFTP connector in Lambda function to transfer files from SFTP server which can be running anywhere. Step functions is used to orchastrate the execution flow of 2 Lambda functions. EventBridge is used to schedule periodic execution of the Step function. The Lambda functions retrieves the list of files created or updated after the last execution of transfer jobs. These files are transferred from source SFTP server to S3. It uses SFTP connector to retrieve the file list and to transfer the files. Retrying file transfer is implemented in Lambda function. EventBridge and SQS are used to log failure events from the file transfer jobs. These events are processed by Lambda function to retry file transfer.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd lambda-sftp-connector-stepfunction
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:
    ```
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
1. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

1. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.

## How it works

Explain how the service interaction works.

## Testing

Go to EventBridge schedule and check the configured time of Step functions execution. You may manually execute the Step functions. Once the execution is complete, check S3 buckets. All files present in the source SFTP server are transferred to given S3 bucket.

## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME
    ```
1. Confirm the stack has been deleted
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'STACK_NAME')].StackStatus"
    ```
